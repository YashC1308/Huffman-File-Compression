# Text file compression

File compression software for compressing text files(.txt files) using Huffman coding algorithm. It converts the text file into a binary file(.dat file). The binary file(.dat file) obtained can be converted back to text file(.txt file).
It is written in C++.

## Getting started

First fork the main repository into your local repositories. Then clone the repository that you have forked into your local machine.
Launch the terminal and navigate into the **huffman-compression** folder.

Now type the following commands:
- to compile the .cpp files

    ```shell
    make
    ```

- to run the program

    ```shell
    ./run-huffman
    ```
